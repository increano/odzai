# Phase 1 Completion Plan

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete Phase 1 of the Actual Budget extensibility project.

## 1. Transaction Management Enhancements
- ✅ **Search & Filtering**: Add a search box above the transactions table to filter by payee, category, or amount
- ✅ **Sorting**: Allow column header clicks to sort transactions by date, amount, etc.
- ✅ **Batch Operations**: Enable selecting multiple transactions for batch editing/deletion
- ✅ **Transaction Splits**: Implement the ability to split transactions across multiple categories

## 2. Basic Reporting
- ✅ **Spending by Category**: Create a simple view showing total spending by category
- ✅ **Income vs Expenses**: Add a monthly comparison of income vs. expenses
- ✅ **Account Balance History**: Show account balance changes over time

## 3. Core Financial Features
- ⏳ **Scheduled Transactions**: Add support for recurring transactions
- ⏳ **Account Reconciliation**: Implement the ability to reconcile accounts with statements
- ⏳ **Budget Copy**: Allow copying budget amounts from previous months

## 4. Data Export/Import
- ⏳ **CSV Export**: Add transaction export functionality
- ⏳ **Simple Import**: Support basic CSV import for transactions

## 5. UX Improvements
- ⏳ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add basic keyboard navigation
- ✅ **Confirmation Dialogs**: Add confirmation for destructive operations
- ⏳ **Success/Error Messages**: Improve feedback for all operations

## Implementation Priority
1. ✅ Focus first on transaction enhancements since that foundation is already solid
2. ✅ Next implement basic reporting views to demonstrate data analysis capabilities
3. ⏳ Then add core financial features that demonstrate the full capabilities of the Actual engine
4. ⏳ Finally add the import/export and UX improvements

## Goal
Complete a fully functional minimal UI that demonstrates all the core capabilities of Actual's engine while maintaining a clean separation between the UI and core logic. This provides the foundation for Phase 2 (Plugin SDK development).

## Progress Update
We have successfully completed all Transaction Management Enhancements and Basic Reporting features. The foundation of the minimal UI is solid, with robust implementation of transaction management including the complex split transaction functionality. This establishes a strong basis for the remaining items.
