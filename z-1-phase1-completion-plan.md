# Phase 1 Completion Plan

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete Phase 1 of the Actual Budget extensibility project.

## 1. Transaction Management Enhancements
- ✅ **Search & Filtering**: Add a search box above the transactions table to filter by payee, category, or amount
- ✅ **Sorting**: Allow column header clicks to sort transactions by date, amount, etc.
- ✅ **Batch Operations**: Enable selecting multiple transactions for batch editing/deletion
- ✅ **Transaction Splits**: Implement the ability to split transactions across multiple categories

## 2. Basic Reporting
- ✅ **Spending by Category**: Create a simple view showing total spending by category
- ✅ **Income vs Expenses**: Add a monthly comparison of income vs. expenses
- ✅ **Account Balance History**: Show account balance changes over time

## 3. Budget Management
- ✅ **Create New Budgets**: Implement interface for creating new budget files
- ✅ **Budget Editor**: Enhanced budget editing interface with summary information
- ✅ **Budget Operations**: Add functionality to copy from previous months and reset budgets

## 4. Core Financial Features
- ⏳ **Scheduled Transactions**: Add support for recurring transactions
- ⏳ **Account Reconciliation**: Implement the ability to reconcile accounts with statements

## 5. Data Export/Import
- ⏳ **CSV Export**: Add transaction export functionality
- ⏳ **Simple Import**: Support basic CSV import for transactions

## 6. UX Improvements
- ⏳ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add basic keyboard navigation
- ✅ **Confirmation Dialogs**: Add confirmation for destructive operations
- ✅ **Success/Error Messages**: Improve feedback for all operations

## Implementation Priority
1. ✅ Focus first on transaction enhancements since that foundation is already solid
2. ✅ Next implement basic reporting views to demonstrate data analysis capabilities
3. ✅ Add budget management features including new budget creation and editing
4. ⏳ Implement remaining core financial features (scheduled transactions, reconciliation)
5. ⏳ Finally add the import/export and UX improvements

## Goal
Complete a fully functional minimal UI that demonstrates all the core capabilities of Actual's engine while maintaining a clean separation between the UI and core logic. This provides the foundation for Phase 2 (Plugin SDK development).

## Progress Update
We have successfully completed all Transaction Management Enhancements, Basic Reporting features, and Budget Management capabilities. 

With these key features implemented, users can now:
1. Create and manage budgets directly in the minimal UI
2. Allocate budget amounts to categories and track spending
3. Copy budget amounts from previous months
4. View summary information for budget progress
5. Manage transactions with comprehensive features including splits

The next logical features to implement are Scheduled Transactions and Account Reconciliation, which will further enhance the practical utility of the minimal UI.
