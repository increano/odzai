## How to Use This Documentation

1. **Start with the Roadmap**: The [Performance Improvement Roadmap](./z-9-performance-improvement-roadmap.md) provides an overview of our performance strategy and progress.

2. **Review Architecture Guidelines**: The [Preventing UI Freeze Architecture Guide](./z-8-preventing-ui-freeze-architecture-guide.md) provides essential patterns for preventing UI freezes.

3. **Understand Implementation Details**: The implementation documents in the "Current focus" directory provide specific details on implemented components.

4. **Follow Standards and Processes**: The [Performance Review Process](./Current%20focus/performance-review-process.md) outlines how to ensure performance is maintained in new features.

## Contributing to Performance Documentation

When adding or updating performance documentation:

1. Add new implementation documents to the "Current focus" directory
2. Update this index file to reference new documentation
3. Ensure documentation follows our standard format with clear sections
4. Update the status of documents as they evolve
5. Link related documents to provide a complete picture of performance considerations
