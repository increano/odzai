# Performance Review Process

## Overview

This document establishes the formal review process for evaluating performance implications of new features, changes, and optimizations in our application. The process ensures performance remains a first-class consideration throughout development.

## Goals

- Prevent performance regressions from being introduced into the codebase
- Establish clear performance expectations for all development work
- Create consistency in how performance is evaluated and measured
- Provide developers with specific feedback to optimize their code
- Maintain long-term performance stability as the application grows

## Performance Review Workflow

### 1. Pre-Implementation Planning

Before implementing significant features or changes, developers should:

1. **Define Performance Requirements**:
   - Document expected performance characteristics
   - Identify potential performance impacts on existing features
   - Set measurable performance goals (load times, interaction delays, etc.)

2. **Complete Performance Consideration Checklist**:
   ```markdown
   ## Performance Considerations
   - [ ] Does this feature involve large data sets?
   - [ ] Does this feature introduce new API requests?
   - [ ] Will this feature impact critical rendering paths?
   - [ ] Does this feature add significant JavaScript to bundles?
   - [ ] Will this feature affect Core Web Vitals?
   - [ ] Are there mobile performance considerations?
   ```

### 2. Implementation Guidelines

During implementation, developers should follow these practices:

1. **Measure Before Optimizing**:
   - Establish baseline performance metrics for affected areas
   - Use appropriate tools (Performance panel, Lighthouse, etc.)
   - Document these baselines in the implementation plan

2. **Apply Performance Patterns**:
   - Follow documented performance patterns from our guides
   - Implement code-splitting where appropriate
   - Avoid redundant re-renders and expensive calculations
   - Use appropriate data loading strategies

3. **Self-Review**:
   - Before requesting review, run performance tests locally
   - Compare results against baselines and requirements
   - Fix obvious performance issues before team review

### 3. Pull Request Review Process

Each PR that may impact performance requires the following:

1. **Performance Impact Section**:
   ```markdown
   ## Performance Impact
   - **Bundle Size Change**: +/- XX KB
   - **Render Time Change**: +/- XX ms
   - **Network Requests Added/Removed**: Description of changes
   - **Areas Potentially Affected**: List components/features
   ```

2. **Automated Performance Checks**:
   - Lighthouse CI results must be attached
   - Bundle size analysis must be included
   - Visual regression tests must pass

3. **Performance Reviewer Assignment**:
   - At least one reviewer with performance expertise must approve
   - The reviewer will use the "Performance Review Checklist"

4. **Review Checklist for Reviewers**:
   ```markdown
   ## Performance Review
   - [ ] Bundle size impact is acceptable
   - [ ] Render performance meets requirements
   - [ ] No unnecessary re-renders observed
   - [ ] API calls are optimized and minimized
   - [ ] Expensive operations are handled appropriately
   - [ ] Mobile performance is considered
   - [ ] Component design follows performance best practices
   ```

### 4. Post-Implementation Monitoring

After changes are merged:

1. **Short-term Monitoring**:
   - Monitor performance metrics for 48 hours after deployment
   - Watch for unexpected performance degradation
   - Be prepared to roll back if critical issues arise

2. **Integration with Performance Alerts**:
   - Ensure new features are covered by existing performance alerts
   - Add specific alerts for new critical paths if needed
   - Set appropriate thresholds based on baseline measurements

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Developer Responsibilities

- Complete performance consideration checklist before implementation
- Measure and document baseline performance
- Follow performance patterns and guidelines
- Run local performance tests before requesting review
- Address performance feedback from reviewers

### Reviewer Responsibilities

- Verify performance measurements are accurate
- Check implementation against performance best practices
- Provide actionable feedback for performance improvements
- Approve only when performance requirements are met

### Performance Champion Responsibilities

- Maintain performance review process documentation
- Provide training and guidance on performance best practices
- Help resolve complex performance issues
- Review performance trends across the application

## Tools and Resources

### Performance Measurement Tools

- Lighthouse (Overall performance, Core Web Vitals)
- Chrome DevTools Performance Panel (Runtime performance)
- Next.js Bundle Analyzer (Bundle size impact)
- React Profiler (Component render performance)
- Custom performance metrics API (Application-specific metrics)

## Exemption Process

In rare cases, features may need exemption from certain performance requirements:

1. **Exemption Request**:
   - Document specific performance requirements that cannot be met
   - Provide business justification for the exemption
   - Outline future plans to address performance issues
   - Get approval from team lead and performance champion

2. **Mitigation Plans**:
   - Document plans to minimize performance impact
   - Set timeline for resolving performance issues
   - Implement monitoring for the specific performance concern

## Continuous Improvement

This performance review process itself is subject to review and improvement:

1. **Quarterly Process Review**:
   - Evaluate effectiveness of the review process
   - Gather feedback from developers and reviewers
   - Update guidelines based on emerging best practices
   - Adjust performance budgets as needed

2. **Performance Metrics Recalibration**:
   - Regularly update baseline performance expectations
   - Adjust thresholds based on application growth
   - Incorporate new performance metrics as they become relevant

## Implementation Status

This review process has been fully implemented with the following components:

- Performance consideration checklist template
- PR template with performance impact section
- GitHub Action workflows for automated performance checks
- Reviewer guidelines and training
- Integration with existing performance monitoring systems

The process is now mandatory for all changes that may impact application performance.
