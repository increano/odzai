## Prioritization Guide

When implementing these improvements, use the following priority levels:

1. **P0 (Critical)**: Fixes for issues causing complete UI freezes or blocking user workflows
2. **P1 (High)**: Improvements that significantly impact core user experience
3. **P2 (Medium)**: Optimizations that enhance performance but aren't blocking
4. **P3 (Low)**: Nice-to-have improvements with minimal user impact

## Resources Required

- 1-2 dedicated frontend developers per phase
- UX designer for loading state and transition designs
- QA engineer for performance testing
- DevOps support for monitoring setup

## Success Validation

To validate our improvements, we'll use a combination of:

- **Automated Performance Testing**: Lighthouse scores, bundle analysis, and custom metrics
- **User Testing**: Task completion time measurement and satisfaction surveys
- **Analytics**: User engagement metrics and bounce/exit rates
- **Error Monitoring**: Reduction in console errors and failed interactions

By following this roadmap, we'll systematically address our performance issues while establishing patterns that prevent future problems. The phased approach allows us to deliver value incrementally while building toward a comprehensive solution.
