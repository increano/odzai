**Customer Discovery Analysis: Budgeting Tool Users**

## **Empathy Map**

**Says:**

* *“I don’t want to mess with Excel or complicated formulas – I just need a simple way to track my spending.”*

* *“I tried Mint, but it was too rigid. I couldn’t adjust my budget when things changed.”*

* *“Budgeting gives me peace of mind. I’d feel **lost** without my budgeting app.”*

**Thinks:**

* *“Am I doing this right? Will I have enough for next month’s bills?”*

* *“This app doesn’t understand my needs – I wish it considered **my** priorities.”*

* *“Overspending in one category shouldn’t make me feel guilty; life happens and budgets should adapt.”*

**Does:**

* Researches and tries multiple budgeting tools (e.g. Mint, EveryDollar, YNAB) before settling.

* Checks the budget around payday (weekly or monthly) to allocate income and review expenses.

* Manually categorizes transactions or moves money between categories when overspending occurs (if the tool allows).

**Feels:**

* Stressed and anxious when finances are disorganized or when a tool shows lots of red/negative balances.

* Relieved and **in control** after budgeting – “finally knowing where my money is going” gives confidence.

* Frustrated when tools are complex or inflexible (some users even considered hiring a coach to set up YNAB due to its complexity).

* Motivated and empowered when they see progress (e.g. debt balances dropping, savings growing), or when a tool celebrates their achievements.

## **Jobs To Be Done (JTBD)**

**Functional Jobs:** *(When I... I want to... So I can...)*

* **When I get paid**, I want to assign every dollar a purpose *so I can* cover bills, save for goals, and avoid overspending before the next paycheck.

* **When I make a purchase**, I want it recorded and categorized easily *so I can* track my expenses in real-time without extra work.

* **When I plan for upcoming expenses**, I want to set money aside or forecast them *so I can* handle irregular bills (like insurance or holidays) without surprise.

**Emotional Jobs:**

* **When I budget each month**, I want to feel confident and in control *so I can* reduce my stress about money.

* **When an unexpected expense hits**, I want to adjust my budget without shame *so I can* stay calm and resilient rather than feeling like a failure.

* **When I think about my financial future**, I want reassurance that I’m on the right track *so I can* feel secure and optimistic instead of anxious.

**Social Jobs:**

* **When I discuss finances with my partner (or friends)**, I want to show that I have a clear plan *so I can* be seen as financially responsible and build trust.

* **When I compare myself to others**, I want to use modern tools and good habits *so I can* feel confident that I’m managing money as well as (or better than) my peers.

## **Key Pain Points**

* **Rigid budgeting tools:** Many existing apps force a static structure – users complain they can’t easily reallocate money between categories when needs change mid-month. This lack of flexibility makes real-life budgeting harder.

* **Complexity & learning curve:** Some tools (e.g. YNAB) are powerful but initially confusing or time-consuming to set up. New users feel overwhelmed; one even noted being ready to pay $100 for a coach to help set up YNAB’s “quite complex system”.

* **Lack of forecasting:** Users are frustrated that most tools focus only on tracking past and present expenses, with little support for planning ahead. It’s hard to budget for future events or irregular expenses in many apps. (While YNAB tries to address this by showing average past spending as a guide, others largely ignore it.)

* **Limited personalization:** Budget apps often use generic categories and rules that don’t account for individual preferences or unique financial situations. Users feel the tools don’t adapt to *their* lifestyle (e.g. prioritizing travel vs. dining out).

* **Punitive handling of overspending:** In many tools, overspending a category turns the budget red with no guidance, which users say feels like being “punished”. The end goal is peace of mind, but rigid apps can add stress by making users feel they failed if a category goes over.

* **Manual effort and gaps:** If a tool lacks account syncing, users must enter transactions by hand (tedious and error-prone). Others note missing features like integrated debt tracking or robust reporting, forcing them to use extra spreadsheets or websites (e.g. using Undebt.it separately for debt payoff plans).

* **Platform limitations:** A secondary pain point is access – while mobile apps are appreciated, many users are okay starting on desktop. The bigger issue is not device but *design*: clunky interfaces (one user “hates the iPhone app” of their budgeting tool) and poor user experience can be barriers.

## **Desired Outcomes**

* **Financial control and peace of mind:** Ultimately, users want to feel *calm and confident* about their money. The primary outcome is reducing money stress – having a budget that gives them peace of mind rather than additional anxiety. They want to clearly see what’s safe to spend, knowing bills and savings are covered.

* **Achieving goals and paying off debt:** Practically, users measure success by reaching their financial goals. They want to **pay down debt** (often the \#1 priority) and save for future milestones (home, car, vacation, emergency fund). Current tools that don’t explicitly help plan for these goals leave a gap in user satisfaction.

* **Flexible, “life-proof” budgeting:** Users desire a budgeting system that adapts to real life – one that can handle fluctuating expenses or income. The desired outcome is a budget that *works with* their lifestyle, not against it. For example, being able to shift funds when needed and plan for irregular expenses means the tool is supporting them, not scolding them. (Flexibility was a recurring theme in interviews.)

* **Clarity and insight into spending:** They want a clear picture of where their money goes. This includes easy-to-understand summaries of spending by category, trends over time, and maybe a “big picture” view of all accounts in one place. If their current tool only tracks transactions without insightful summaries or recommendations, it’s not meeting this desired outcome.

* **Confidence in decision-making:** Users ultimately want to make better decisions with their money. A successful budgeting tool should empower them to decide “Can I afford this?” or “Should I adjust my plan?” with confidence. When tools fail to provide context (e.g. no forward-looking data or what-if scenarios), users feel a gap – they still lack guidance on *future* decisions even if past spending is tracked.

## **User Segmentation**

Based on behaviors and needs observed, a few distinct user personas emerge:

* **“Debt Crusher”:** Highly motivated to eliminate debt as fast as possible. This user measures budgeting success by how quickly they can pay down credit cards, student loans, etc. They budget very strictly, funneling any surplus to debt payments. *Needs:* Clear tracking of debt balances and progress, and tools to prioritize payments (e.g. snowball/avalanche methods). *Pain points:* Generic budget apps that don’t highlight debt payoff or require separate tools for debt tracking. This user likely references tools like Undebt.it to supplement their budgeting.

* **“Goal-Oriented Planner”:** Focused on saving for specific goals and future plans. They might be saving for a house, building an emergency fund, or planning for a life event. They use budgeting to allocate money toward these goals every month. *Needs:* Strong forecasting and goal-setting features (ability to set targets and see timeframes), and the ability to plan ahead for irregular big expenses. *Pain points:* Budget tools that only show month-to-month data without projecting ahead or tracking progress toward goals frustrate them. They value features that help “plan for future expenses” (a commonly requested addition).

* **“Emotional Spender”:** Struggles with impulse spending and wants budgeting to impose discipline and awareness. This persona might shop or spend when stressed or for instant gratification, and later feel regret. They turn to budgeting to curb those habits and feel more in control. *Needs:* A simple, user-friendly tool that gently keeps them on track – for example, spending alerts or visual cues before it’s too late, and encouragement to make trade-offs. They benefit from features that tie spending to personal values (e.g. distinguishing “joy” purchases from mindless ones). *Pain points:* Complicated apps will scare them off; they need an intuitive experience. Also, if an app is too punitive (all red flags for overspending), they may abandon it out of discouragement. They appreciate a “roll with the punches” philosophy that forgives occasional slip-ups.

* **“Convenience Seeker” (Spreadsheet Skeptic):** Does not want the hassle of managing finances manually. Often this is someone who knows budgeting is important but finds spreadsheets or traditional methods too cumbersome or intimidating. They prefer an automated, polished solution and are even willing to pay for it if it saves time and effort. *Needs:* Seamless account syncing (to avoid manual data entry), an easy setup, and a clean UI. They want budgeting “out-of-the-box” with minimal learning curve. *Pain points:* If a tool requires advanced knowledge or too much maintenance, they won’t stick with it. Many in this group explicitly *don’t* want to learn Excel or mimic a complicated system themselves – convenience and simplicity are top priorities.

*(Note: Real users may span multiple personas – e.g. a Goal-Oriented Planner can also be a Convenience Seeker – but these segments highlight primary motivations.)*

## **Competitive Analysis**

Users in the study mentioned several existing budgeting tools. Below is a brief overview of each, with key features, strengths, weaknesses, and gaps as experienced by users:

**Mint:**

* **Key Features:** Automatic account aggregation (links to bank/credit accounts to pull transactions), expense categorization, monthly budgets, bill reminders, and basic financial summaries. Free (ad-supported) product.

* **Strengths:** Provides a consolidated view of all finances in one place with minimal setup. Good for tracking spending after-the-fact. Its ease of linking accounts and zero price tag make it a popular starting tool.

* **Weaknesses:** Budgeting in Mint can be relatively inflexible – users noted you can’t truly customize how money is moved around once categories are set in a month. It’s more reactive (showing what you spent) than proactive. The interface can overwhelm with data and ads, and lacks guidance for future planning or managing trade-offs. Syncing issues and category misclassifications are common complaints.

* **Gaps in User Value:** Mint doesn’t explicitly help users plan *ahead* or adjust when things change. There’s no envelope-style system for reallocating funds, and overspending just shows up as a negative with no suggestion on what to do. Personalization is limited; it doesn’t account for individual goals or spending “preferences” beyond setting generic budgets. Users looking for deeper insight or forward-looking advice often outgrow Mint.

**EveryDollar:**

* **Key Features:** Zero-based budgeting app from Dave Ramsey’s team. Encourages users to budget every dollar of income each month. Offers both a free version (manual entry) and a paid version (which adds bank sync). Focused on monthly budgeting and tracking spending against plan.

* **Strengths:** Very simple and user-friendly for beginners. The philosophy aligns with a popular financial program (Ramsey’s Baby Steps), which resonates with users who want to get out of debt and control spending strictly. It has an intuitive interface for setting up a monthly budget quickly.

* **Weaknesses:** Lacks flexibility and advanced features. The free version requiring manual input can be tedious. Even in paid, the tool mainly enforces a strict monthly plan; if you overspend in a category, it doesn’t inherently offer an easy way to re-balance except the user manually editing things. There is little support for forecasting beyond the current month or customizing beyond basic categories.

* **Gaps in User Value:** EveryDollar doesn’t cater well to those who want to plan for irregular future expenses or those who desire more analysis. It also assumes a consistent income month-to-month (less friendly for irregular earners). Social or emotional components (like rewarding good behavior or providing peace-of-mind features) are minimal – it’s a straightforward budgeting ledger. Users who need more dynamic planning or nudges may find it lacking.

**Quicken:**

* **Key Features:** A comprehensive personal finance software (historically desktop-based). It handles budgeting, bill tracking, account balances, investments, and reporting. Now offers a subscription model with cloud sync and a companion app (and also a newer simplified app “Simplifi”).

* **Strengths:** Very feature-rich and powerful for those who want detailed control over finances. Quicken can track almost everything (from daily expenses to retirement accounts) and generate detailed reports. Longtime users appreciate having decades of financial history in one place.

* **Weaknesses:** Quicken is overkill for the average budgeter. Its complexity and old-school interface can be intimidating for someone just wanting to manage monthly spending. It’s not designed around modern budgeting philosophies like zero-based budgeting or envelope flexibility. The learning curve is steep, and it’s not as accessible on mobile (the full functionality is desktop-only).

* **Gaps in User Value:** For budgeting specifically, Quicken lacks the focused guidance that dedicated budget apps provide. It doesn’t encourage the kind of behavioral change or envelope-style money movement that many users (especially in this research) seek. Any forward-looking planning requires manual setup of projections or using spreadsheets. Essentially, it’s a powerful general tool, but fails to deliver the **flexibility** or simplicity that budget-focused users want, leaving an opportunity for more user-centric budgeting solutions.

**You Need A Budget (YNAB):**

* **Key Features:** A zero-based budgeting tool with a unique method (“give every dollar a job”). It links accounts, lets users allocate funds to category envelopes, and supports dynamic adjustments. Key features include goal tracking, expense averaging to guide monthly allotments, and multi-device access (web/mobile).

* **Strengths:** Highly effective for those who adopt it – enforces living within means and planning for true expenses. YNAB’s philosophy addresses many pain points: it allows moving money between categories easily and without guilt (“roll with the punches” approach to overspending), and it encourages planning for infrequent expenses by using past averages. Users praise the **peace of mind** it provides once they get the hang of it, and many become very loyal, citing life-changing benefits.

* **Weaknesses:** Steep learning curve and setup effort. Several users find it initially confusing or hard to stick with; it’s a system that requires habit changes. YNAB is also a paid subscription, which is a barrier for some (though many are willing to pay for the value). Its feature set is narrowly focused on budgeting – for example, it doesn’t have built-in debt payoff planners (users often use external tools for that) and only limited forecasting (you can set goals and future transactions, but there’s no long-term projection graph). A few usability issues were noted (e.g. some dislike the mobile app experience or find certain new features “clunky”).

* **Gaps in User Value:** YNAB largely meets functional needs for committed budgeters, but it leaves some needs unmet for others. New users who are *Convenience Seekers* struggle with its complexity – the need for tutorials or even paid coaching was mentioned. Additionally, those who want extensive analytics or automatic suggestions won’t find them in YNAB (it relies on the user to reflect and adjust). Its handling of debt could be stronger (hence references to Undebt.it by YNAB fans for tracking debt payoff separately). These gaps indicate room for a tool that is as empowering as YNAB but more accessible and comprehensive in guidance.

**Undebt.it:**

* **Key Features:** A specialized online tool for debt management. Users input their debts (balances, interest, payments) and Undebt.it generates payoff plans (debt snowball, avalanche, etc.), tracking progress and projecting payoff dates. It’s often used alongside a budgeting system to focus on debt reduction.

* **Strengths:** Fulfills the specific job of **organizing debt payoff** very well. It’s simple to use for its purpose, visualizing the debt-free journey and helping users decide the best payoff strategy. Great for motivation – seeing each debt’s timeline and getting reminders of progress. It’s also either free or low-cost, lowering barriers for users already burdened by debt.

* **Weaknesses:** Limited to debt tracking – it doesn’t manage day-to-day budgeting or expense tracking. Users must use another app for overall budgeting and then update or consult Undebt.it separately for their debt status. There may be some integration with other tools (CSV import/exports), but it’s not an all-in-one solution. The interface is functional but not very modern or engaging beyond the debt charts.

* **Gaps in User Value:** Undebt.it addresses a gap left by general budgeting apps (which often lack robust debt payoff planning). However, because it’s separate, users experience fragmentation in their financial management. The need to juggle a budgeting app and a debt tool highlights an opportunity: integrating debt payoff features into a budgeting platform would eliminate this divide. Users would benefit from seeing how their budget decisions directly impact their debt timeline in one place. Additionally, any lack of automation (like having to manually update balances) is a pain point that an integrated solution could solve by linking accounts.

## **Innovation Opportunities**

Based on the unmet needs and pain points above, there are several opportunities to design a better budgeting solution for these users:

* **Streamlined UI/UX and Onboarding:** Design the app for simplicity from the start. Provide a friendly onboarding wizard that asks users about their income, bills, and goals and helps set up the budget automatically (great for the *Convenience Seeker* persona). Use tooltips or guided tours to explain features. The interface should minimize jargon – for example, use human language like “Rainy Day Fund” instead of obscure terms. A focus on ease-of-use addresses the large segment of users who lack spreadsheet skills or find current tools intimidating. (The goal: no one should feel they need to pay a coach just to start using the app\!)

* **Account Aggregation & Auto-Categorization:** Implement robust **account syncing** to pull in transactions from banks/credit cards (a must-have identified in research). Use machine learning to auto-categorize expenses accurately to save users time. To enhance trust, allow users to easily recategorize and learn from corrections. This satisfies the need for convenience and reduces manual data entry, ensuring even busy users keep their budgets up to date.

* **Personalized Summaries and Insights:** Go beyond basic charts by providing **summarized, meaningful insights**. For example, a weekly summary: “You spent $500 on food this month, which is 10% over your usual. At this rate, you’ll short your savings goal.” Use simple visuals to show trends (trend graphs/reporting were noted as important). Incorporate the user’s preferences: if they value travel highly, frame insights in terms of trade-offs (“Saving this extra $50 on dining out means more for your travel fund”). By highlighting patterns and consequences in context, the tool helps users make informed decisions rather than just presenting raw data.

* **Contextual Budget-Based Reminders:** Introduce smart reminders and alerts that tie into the user’s budget context. For instance, a push notification mid-month if a major category (like groceries) is 80% spent, suggesting they might want to slow spending there. Or a reminder a few days before payday to review and allocate the new income. These reminders increase *awareness* (a must-have) and keep users engaged with their plan. Importantly, make them adjustable so they’re helpful, not annoying – e.g. the user can choose to get an alert for certain categories or thresholds. This feature supports the emotional need to feel on top of finances without having to constantly check the app manually.

* **“Roll with the Punches” Flexibility:** Build the budgeting framework to be **flexible by design**. Users should be able to move money between categories with a simple drag-and-drop or a couple of taps, and the app should positively reinforce this as an *okay* thing to do when needed. For example, if a user overspends $50 in groceries, a prompt could say: “No worries\! Would you like to cover this by moving $50 from your ‘Dining Out’ category or from Savings?” – turning a potentially guilt-ridden moment into a quick solution. This embodies the YNAB-like philosophy that resonated with users (adjusting instead of feeling punished), delivering peace of mind. By making flexibility a core feature, the tool differentiates itself from rigid budgeting apps.

* **Future Planning & Goal Integration:** Incorporate features for **forecasting and planning ahead**, which users consistently desire. The app could have a "Future Expenses" planner where users list upcoming big expenses (annual insurance, holiday gifts, car maintenance) and it automatically sets aside a portion of the budget each month toward those. It could also use historical data to suggest how much one might need for irregular categories (similar to YNAB’s averaging, but more explicit). Additionally, integrate goal tracking: if a user has a goal (say $5,000 vacation fund in 12 months), the app shows progress and even suggests adjustments (e.g. “You're slightly behind on your vacation savings – consider moving $100 from unused categories this month”). By filling the forecasting gap, the tool helps the *Goal-Oriented Planner* and anyone looking to the future.

* **Machine Learning & Personalization:** Leverage ML to provide tailored advice. For example, classify expenses by the **joy or value** they bring (perhaps using a concept like the KonMari method applied to spending, as one interview note suggested). Then the app might highlight “low joy” expenses that could be cut painlessly. Or use predictive modeling: if the app notices “You usually spend around $300 on utilities in winter,” it can prompt the user to budget accordingly for the coming month. Personalization could also mean adjusting the interface based on user behavior (noticing that a user rarely adjusts their budget mid-month? The app could prompt them with tips on using the flexibility features). Such intelligent personalization addresses both functional needs (optimal budgeting) and emotional needs (feeling understood and guided).

* **Integrated Debt Management:** Build in a **debt payoff module** so that *Debt Crushers* don’t need a separate tool. Within the app, let users input their debts or pull in loan accounts. Offer payoff strategy options (snowball vs. avalanche) and show a clear timeline of becoming debt-free. Crucially, tie this into the budget: when the user allocates extra money to debt, the progress timeline updates, reinforcing their achievement. Conversely, if they consider reducing a debt payment one month, show the impact (“this will extend your payoff by 2 months”). By embedding Undebt.it-like functionality, the app delivers value that current competitors lack, all in one place. This integration not only simplifies the user’s toolset but also feeds their motivation by directly connecting daily budgeting choices with the ultimate goal of debt freedom.

Each of these innovation opportunities addresses specific gaps that current budgeting solutions leave open. By focusing on flexibility, personalization, and forward-looking guidance – all anchored in real user feedback – a new budgeting tool can better align with what users **say, think, do, and feel**, ultimately providing a more empathetic and effective financial companion.
