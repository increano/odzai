# GoCardless Implementation Roadmap for minimal-ui-next

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step implementation process for integrating GoCardless bank synchronization into the minimal-ui-next application. The implementation is divided into phases, with each phase building upon the previous one to achieve the complete integration.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)

### Step 1: Environment Configuration
- [ ] Add necessary dependencies
  ```bash
  yarn add nordigen-node uuid
  ```
- [ ] Create configuration structure for GoCardless credentials
- [ ] Set up secure storage for API keys and tokens

### Step 2: Basic API Endpoints
- [ ] Implement GoCardless configuration endpoints
  - [ ] POST `/api/gocardless/setup` - Store and validate credentials
  - [ ] GET `/api/gocardless/status` - Check configuration status
- [ ] Set up error handling middleware for GoCardless-specific errors

### Step 3: GoCardless Client Implementation
- [ ] Create a GoCardless client service
  ```typescript
  // src/services/gocardless-client.ts
  import * as nordigenNode from 'nordigen-node';
  
  export class GoCardlessClient {
    private client: any;
    
    constructor(secretId: string, secretKey: string) {
      this.client = new nordigenNode.default({ secretId, secretKey });
    }
    
    async generateToken() {
      // Implementation
    }
    
    // Other methods...
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement token generation and refreshing
- [ ] Add methods for fetching banks by country

### Step 4: UI for Credentials Setup
- [ ] Create `GoCardlessSetupForm` component
  - [ ] Secret ID input field
  - [ ] Secret Key input field
  - [ ] Validation and submission handling
- [ ] Update `CreateAccountDialog` to include tabs for manual and bank connection

## Phase 2: Bank Connection Flow (Weeks 3-4)

### Step 1: Bank Selection Interface
- [ ] Implement country selection dropdown
- [ ] Create bank search/selection interface
- [ ] Add API endpoints for bank listing
  - [ ] GET `/api/gocardless/banks` - Get available banks by country

### Step 2: Bank Authorization Flow
- [ ] Implement bank connection initialization endpoint
  - [ ] POST `/api/gocardless/connect` - Create requisition and get authorization link
- [ ] Create authorization redirect handler
- [ ] Implement authorization status checking mechanism

### Step 3: Account Selection UI
- [ ] Create account selection component
  - [ ] Display account details (name, balance, etc.)
  - [ ] Allow selection of multiple accounts
  - [ ] Enable configuration of Off Budget status
- [ ] Implement API endpoint for fetching available accounts
  - [ ] GET `/api/gocardless/accounts` - Fetch accounts from connected bank

### Step 4: Account Linking and Creation
- [ ] Implement account linking endpoint
  - [ ] POST `/api/accounts/link` - Link GoCardless account to Actual
- [ ] Update account model to store GoCardless-specific metadata
- [ ] Enhance account creation process to handle GoCardless accounts

## Phase 3: Transaction Synchronization (Weeks 5-6)

### Step 1: Initial Transaction Import
- [ ] Implement transaction fetching from GoCardless
- [ ] Create data normalization utilities for transactions
- [ ] Add logic to avoid duplicate transactions based on imported_id
- [ ] Implement initial account balance setting

### Step 2: Manual Sync Functionality
- [ ] Add sync button to account details page
- [ ] Implement transaction sync endpoint
  - [ ] POST `/api/accounts/{id}/sync` - Sync transactions for specific account
- [ ] Create UI for sync status and progress

### Step 3: Transaction Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Implement conflict detection for transactions
- [ ] Create strategy for handling duplicate transactions
- [ ] Add reconciliation mechanism for mismatched balances

### Step 4: Error Handling and Recovery
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling for API failures
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms for transient errors
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages and recovery suggestions

## Phase 4: Polish and Optimization (Weeks 7-8)

### Step 1: UI/UX Refinements
- [ ] Improve loading states and transitions
- [ ] Add tooltips and help text for bank connection flow
- [ ] Create onboarding experience for first-time users

### Step 2: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement batched transaction processing for large accounts
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed bank information
- [ ] Optimize API calls to minimize rate limit usage

### Step 3: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for GoCardless integration
  - [ ] Unit tests for client implementation
  - [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
  - [ ] End-to-end tests for user flows
- [ ] Test with various banks and account types
- [ ] Validate error handling and recovery scenarios

### Step 4: Documentation and Deployment
- [ ] Update user documentation with GoCardless setup instructions
- [ ] Create administrator guide for troubleshooting
- [ ] Finalize deployment process for the integration

## Key Milestones

1. **End of Week 2**: Basic GoCardless setup and configuration UI complete
2. **End of Week 4**: Bank selection and authorization flow working
3. **End of Week 6**: Transaction synchronization functional
4. **End of Week 8**: Complete integrated solution with polished UI and documentation

## Technical Debt Considerations

- Regular monitoring of GoCardless API changes
- Token refresh mechanism needs to be robust
- Consider rate limiting implications for users with many accounts
- Plan for handling API deprecations or changes in the future

## Success Criteria

- Users can successfully connect to their banks via GoCardless
- Account information is accurately imported
- Transactions are correctly synchronized with no duplicates
- Balance reconciliation is accurate
- User experience is intuitive and error messages are helpful
- Performance remains good even with large transaction histories

## Post-Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Monitor error rates and user feedback
- [ ] Gather metrics on connection success rates
- [ ] Schedule regular reviews of GoCardless API changes
- [ ] Plan for additional bank sync providers in the future
