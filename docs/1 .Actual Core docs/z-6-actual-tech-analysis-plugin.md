# Actual Budget - Plugin/Modular Potential Analysis

## Extensibility Foundation

Actual Budget's architecture provides a strong foundation for developing a plugin system. The clear separation between core logic and UI, combined with a well-defined API, creates natural extension points for third-party functionality.

## Reusable Core Components

The most fundamental reusable piece is the **Loot Core engine** itself, which already functions as an SDK for budget data:

- Exposes methods to query and modify budget data
- Handles complex business logic internally
- Maintains data integrity regardless of caller
- Provides event-based notification of changes

A potential **Plugin SDK** would likely wrap these core APIs to provide:
- Controlled access to budget data
- Permission management for plugin capabilities
- Event subscription for real-time updates
- Standardized interfaces for UI extensions

## Extension Opportunities

### Report Generation

The reporting system is an ideal candidate for plugin extensibility:
- Plugins could create custom report types
- The core API already provides data access methods needed for reports
- New visualizations and analytics could be added without modifying core code
- Example: A plugin could create a "Cashflow Forecast" report by analyzing scheduled transactions and historical patterns

### Import/Integration Hooks

Data import and external integrations are natural extension points:
- Bank sync plugins could connect to financial institutions
- Cryptocurrency tracking plugins could import blockchain transactions
- Export plugins could send data to external services or formats
- Example: A plugin could add a "Sync with Bank XYZ" button that uses the bank's API to fetch transactions and insert them via `api.createTransaction`

### UI Components & Theming

The user interface could be extended through:
- New sidebar sections or menu items
- Custom transaction register columns
- Interactive dashboard widgets
- Visual themes and styling options
- Example: A plugin could add a "Savings Goals" section that tracks progress toward specific targets

## Integration Points (Hooks)

To make the application truly extensible, several hook points should be established:

### Transaction Lifecycle Hooks
- `onTransactionCreated` - When a new transaction is added
- `onTransactionUpdated` - When a transaction is modified
- `onTransactionDeleted` - When a transaction is removed
- Example Use: A plugin could watch transactions and automatically tag or split them based on custom rules

### Budget Lifecycle Hooks
- `onMonthClosed` - When a month ends
- `onMonthOpened` - When a new month begins
- `onBudgetChanged` - When budget allocations change
- Example Use: A plugin could generate a monthly summary email when a month closes

### UI Extension Hooks
- `registerRoute` - Add a new page/route to the application
- `registerSidebarItem` - Add an entry to the navigation sidebar
- `registerTransactionColumn` - Add a custom column to transaction registers
- Example Use: A plugin could add an "Investments" section with custom portfolio tracking

### Data Model Extension
- `registerCustomField` - Define additional properties for entities
- `getPluginData`/`setPluginData` - Store plugin-specific data
- Example Use: A plugin could add a "Project" field to transactions for business expense tracking

## Plugin Architecture Design

### Isolated Plugin Modules

For security and stability, plugins should run in isolation:

#### Sandboxing
- Plugins could run in Web Workers (browser) or separate processes (desktop)
- Communication would occur via a defined message protocol
- The main application would validate all plugin requests

#### Permission Model
- Plugins would declare required permissions in a manifest
- Users would approve permissions during installation
- Examples: read-only access, write access, internet access, notification capability

#### Plugin Manifest & Loading
- Each plugin would have a manifest file specifying:
  - Name, version, author, description
  - Required permissions
  - Entry points and UI contributions
  - Configuration options
- The application would load plugins dynamically at startup

#### Events and API Access
- Plugins would receive an API object with permitted methods
- Event subscription would allow plugins to react to changes
- The core would validate all plugin operations for safety

### Potential Plugin Types

Several categories of plugins could be developed:

#### Data Importers/Syncers
- Bank connection plugins
- File format importers
- Cryptocurrency trackers
- Example: A plugin that connects to a specific bank's API to import transactions weekly

#### Automation/Workflows
- Bill pay calendar
- Budget automation rules
- Notification systems
- Example: A plugin that automatically moves leftover budget from one category to another at month's end

#### Integrations
- External service connections
- Export to spreadsheets
- Notification systems
- Example: A plugin that updates a Google Sheet with budget totals each week

#### UI Extensions
- Custom dashboard widgets
- New report types
- Visualization enhancements
- Example: A plugin that adds a cash flow forecasting view

#### Analytics/AI
- Transaction categorization
- Spending pattern analysis
- Budget recommendations
- Example: A plugin that uses AI to suggest optimal budget allocations based on spending history

## Implementation Infrastructure

### Plugin Management

To support plugins, Actual would need:

#### Plugin Manager UI
- Interface for installing, updating, and removing plugins
- Configuration panels for plugin settings
- Permission management and review

#### Marketplace/Registry
- Curated list of available plugins
- User ratings and reviews
- Security verification process

#### Resource Management
- Plugin storage location (directory or database)
- Version compatibility checking
- Resource limitations for plugins

#### Security Monitoring
- Process to report malicious plugins
- Kill-switch for problematic extensions
- Performance monitoring to prevent resource abuse

## Roadmap Integration

The plugin system aligns with the proposed three-phase roadmap:

### Phase 1: Core Setup
- Focus on decoupling the core engine
- Ensure the API is comprehensive and stable
- Document extension points for future plugins

### Phase 2: Plugin SDK
- Develop the plugin infrastructure
- Implement sandboxing and permission model
- Create developer tools and documentation
- Test with sample plugins or internal features

### Phase 3: Marketplace
- Build discovery and installation UX
- Establish plugin review process
- Support monetization if desired
- Foster community development

## Technical Challenges

Implementing a plugin system presents several challenges:

### Security
- Preventing malicious plugins from accessing sensitive data
- Isolating plugin code effectively
- Validating plugin updates for security

### Performance
- Ensuring plugins don't degrade application performance
- Managing resource usage across multiple plugins
- Maintaining the local-first speed advantage

### Compatibility
- Handling API changes without breaking plugins
- Supporting plugins across platforms (desktop, web)
- Versioning plugin interfaces appropriately

### User Experience
- Keeping the interface cohesive despite third-party additions
- Managing plugin conflicts and interactions
- Providing clear error handling for plugin issues

## Conclusion

Actual Budget's architecture is well-suited for extension through plugins. The existing separation of concerns, robust API, and local-first design provide an excellent foundation for building a modular ecosystem.

The potential benefits include:
- Community-driven innovation
- Specialized features for niche use cases
- Integration with external services
- Enhanced customization for users

With careful implementation of sandboxing, permissions, and a plugin marketplace, Actual could evolve from a standalone application into a flexible platform for personal finance management while maintaining its core strengths of privacy, performance, and reliability.
