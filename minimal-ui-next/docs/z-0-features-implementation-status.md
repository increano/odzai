# Actual Budget Implementation Status

This document outlines which features from the phased roadmap have been implemented and which are still pending.

## Phase 1: Core Integration and Custom UI Setup

### ✅ Implemented

- **Integrate Actual Engine:** Successfully integrated the Loot Core engine as the foundation
- **Replace UI:** Developed a minimal UI that uses the API to perform essential actions
- **Partial Feature Parity:**
  - ✅ Transaction Management: Search, filtering, sorting, batch operations, and splits
  - ✅ Basic Reporting: Spending by category, income vs expenses, account balance history
  - ✅ Budget Management: Create new budgets, budget editor, budget operations
  - ✅ Scheduled Transactions: Implemented with a mock data store rather than direct database access

### ⏳ Pending Implementation

- **Complete Feature Parity:**
  - ⏳ Account Reconciliation: Balance verification, transaction clearing, discrepancy identification
  - ⏳ Data Export/Import: CSV export, simple import functionality
  - ⏳ UX Improvements: Keyboard shortcuts and some advanced features

## Phase 2: Plugin SDK and Internal Module Refactoring

### ⏳ Not Yet Started

- **Design Plugin API:** Plugin registration system, event bus, core API wrappers
- **Isolate Plugin Execution:** Sandbox environment, RPC bridge
- **Extending UI for Plugins:** Extension points, dynamic component loading
- **Convert Internal Features to Plugins:** Testing with existing features
- **Security Measures:** Permission system design
- **Developer Experience:** Tools and documentation for plugin developers

## Phase 3: Extensible UX & Marketplace with Monetization

### ⏳ Not Yet Started

- **Plugin UI/UX:** Plugin manager, configuration interface
- **Discovery of Plugins:** Plugin marketplace browser
- **Monetization Support:** Purchase flow, license key system
- **Scaling and Quality:** Resource limits, approval process
- **Extensible UX Elements:** Advanced extension points
- **Community & Monetization Balance:** Ecosystem development
- **Security Monitoring:** Reporting system for problematic plugins

## Current Focus

The project is currently in Phase 1, focusing on implementing core features with a minimal UI. Significant progress has been made with most transaction, budget, and reporting features implemented. The current priority is completing the remaining Phase 1 features:

1. Account Reconciliation
2. Data Export/Import functionality
3. UX Improvements

Once Phase 1 is complete, the project will move to Phase 2, focusing on the Plugin SDK and extensibility infrastructure.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- The scheduled transactions feature was implemented using a mock data store rather than direct database tables due to API limitations
- The UI maintains a clean separation from the core logic, setting the foundation for plugin extensibility
- All implemented features maintain data integrity and follow the local-first philosophy
- The implementation preserves the core strengths of Actual: privacy, performance, and reliability
